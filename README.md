# Minecraft Agent Swarm

A self-improving swarm of autonomous AI agents that play Minecraft together, powered by local LLMs (Ollama) with a hybrid skill system: hand-crafted TypeScript skills, 57 Voyager-style JavaScript skills, and dynamic skill generation at runtime.

Each of the 5 bots specializes in a different area — exploring, farming, mining, building, or combat — and they coordinate through shared context and a central resource stash.

**The bots earn everything in-game.** No item handouts, no teleport rescues, no scripted shortcuts that act on their behalf — progress comes from making the *agents* more capable (better prompts, skills, and action logic), not from cheating for them. Self-improvement is the whole point.

Designed for live streaming: includes a Mission Control dashboard, per-bot 3D viewers, OBS overlays, TTS, and Twitch integration.

> Formerly `mineflayer-chatgpt`. Renamed to reflect what it became: a multi-agent swarm running on local models, not a single ChatGPT bot.

### Bot Team

| Bot | Role | Specialty | Leash Radius |
|-----|------|-----------|-------------|
| **Atlas** | Scout / Explorer | Roams far, discovers ores/biomes, maps terrain | 500 blocks |
| **Flora** | Farmer / Crafter | Grows crops, breeds animals, processes materials | 100 blocks |
| **Forge** | Miner / Smelter | Strip mines, digs tunnels, smelts ores | 250 blocks |
| **Mason** | Builder | Builds houses, bridges, lights areas, manages stash | 150 blocks |
| **Blade** | Combat / Guard | Patrols perimeter, kills hostiles, hunts animals | 300 blocks |

Each bot has its own personality, allowed actions, allowed skills, memory file, and leash radius. They share a central stash of chests for resource exchange and see each other's status via the Team Bulletin.

---

## Setup

### Requirements

- Node.js 20+
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) with `gpt-oss:20b` pulled (one MoE model serves all decision types — chosen by A/B trial over qwen3.6 and nemotron-3-nano for structured-output quality and speed)
- Minecraft Java Edition server (1.21.4) with 5+ player slots
- Python 3.10+ (for neural combat server)

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JesseRWeigel/minecraft-agent-swarm.git
cd minecraft-agent-swarm
npm install
pip install -r requirements.txt   # for neural server
```

### Configure

Create a `.env` file:

```env
# Minecraft server
MC_HOST=localhost
MC_PORT=25565
MC_USERNAME=Atlas
MC_USERNAME_2=Flora
MC_USERNAME_3=Forge
MC_USERNAME_4=Mason
MC_USERNAME_5=Blade
MC_VERSION=1.21.4
MC_AUTH=offline

# LLM backend — "ollama" (default, local) or "openai" (any OpenAI-compatible API)
LLM_PROVIDER=ollama
OLLAMA_HOST=http://localhost:11434
OLLAMA_MODEL=gpt-oss:20b       # MoE: ~3.6B active params, ~200 tok/s on a 32GB GPU
OLLAMA_FAST_MODEL=gpt-oss:20b  # Same model — avoids VRAM eviction thrash between two residents
# Reasoning-native models (gpt-oss) run with think:"low"; qwen needs think:false (auto-detected in src/llm)

# Bot identity
BOT_NAME=Atlas
BOT_IDLE_INTERVAL_MS=10000   # How often the brain re-plans when nothing is happening
BOT_CHAT_COOLDOWN_MS=3000

# Multi-bot mode
ENABLE_MULTI_BOT=true
BOT_COUNT=5                   # 1=Atlas only, 2=+Flora, 5=all bots

# Autonomy
ALLOW_INTERVENTIONS=false     # false (default): LLM decides everything, no cheating.
                              # true: re-enable deterministic scaffolding (demos only)

# Twitch (optional)
TWITCH_CHANNEL=your_channel
TWITCH_BOT_USERNAME=your_bot
TWITCH_OAUTH_TOKEN=oauth:...
```

### Using OpenAI (or any OpenAI-compatible API)

The swarm runs on local Ollama by default. To use a hosted API instead, set
`LLM_PROVIDER=openai` and supply a base URL and key:

```bash
LLM_PROVIDER=openai
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-5.6-terra      # strategic decisions
OPENAI_FAST_MODEL=gpt-5.6-luna  # reactive decisions + critic (defaults to OPENAI_MODEL)
```

Nothing else changes — `npm start` as usual. On boot the banner reports which
backend is live:

```
LLM: gpt-5.6-terra @ https://api.openai.com/v1 [openai]
```

**`OPENAI_MODEL` has no default and startup fails without it.** Model IDs go
stale quickly, so rather than bake in a name that will quietly 404 next quarter,
list what your key can actually reach:

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/models -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY"
```

The IDs above were current in August 2026 (`gpt-5.6` is an alias for
`gpt-5.6-sol`; `terra` is the balanced tier, `luna` the cheap high-volume one).
Check the list before copying them.

Any OpenAI-compatible gateway works; only the base URL and model name change:

| Provider | `OPENAI_BASE_URL` |
|---|---|
| OpenAI | `https://api.openai.com/v1` |
| OpenRouter | `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1` |
| Groq | `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1` |
| Together | `https://api.together.xyz/v1` |
| vLLM / LiteLLM / LM Studio | your own host, ending in `/v1` |

Self-hosted gateways still need `OPENAI_API_KEY` set to something non-empty, even
if they ignore it.

**Two things worth knowing before you switch:**

- **The model must support JSON mode.** Every decision is requested with
  `response_format: {"type": "json_object"}` and parsed as JSON. A model or
  gateway that rejects that field will not work.
- **Don't point `OPENAI_BASE_URL` at a local Ollama's `/v1` to run a qwen3-family
  model.** The `think` control has no OpenAI equivalent, so the model reasons
  until it hits the token cap and returns empty content. Measured on this repo:
  `qwen3.6:35b-a3b` over `/v1` returns `""`, while the same model via
  `LLM_PROVIDER=ollama` returns valid JSON. For local models, use
  `LLM_PROVIDER=ollama`.

**Cost.** This workload is chattier than most. Measured on a five-bot swarm:
roughly **900–1,000 actions per hour**, and each action costs a strategic call
plus a critic call — so ~2,000 API calls/hour, every hour, indefinitely. Prompts
carry world state and skill lists, so they are not small.

Three levers, in order of effect:

1. Put the cheap model in `OPENAI_FAST_MODEL` — it serves the reactive and critic
   paths, about two thirds of all calls.
2. `BOT_CRITIC_ENABLED=false` removes one call per action outright.
3. `BOT_COUNT=1` runs Atlas alone instead of five bots.

Run it metered for an hour and check your usage dashboard before leaving it
unattended overnight.

### Run

```bash
# Start Minecraft server first, then:
npm run dev
```

The bots will:
1. Connect to the Minecraft server (staggered 10s apart)
2. Start the neural combat server automatically
3. Start the unified 3D viewer at `http://localhost:3000` (switch bots with keys 1-5; per-bot ports are a fallback)
4. Start Mission Control dashboard at `http://localhost:3010`
5. Begin autonomous decision loops

> **Note:** All bot usernames must be operators on the server (e.g. `/op Atlas`, `/op Flora`, etc.) so they can set gamerules and use teleport-based spawn safety.

> **Tip:** With `online-mode=false` you can join the world yourself — Direct Connect to `localhost:25565` with any username and watch the bots up close (`/gamemode spectator` for free-flight).

### Single-Bot Mode

To run just Atlas (original single-bot behavior):

```env
ENABLE_MULTI_BOT=false
```

---

## Features

### Multi-Bot Team Coordination

The 5 bots coordinate through **shared context** — no coordinator bot, no task assignment. Each bot's LLM prompt includes a Team Bulletin showing what every other bot is doing:

```
TEAM STATUS (live):
- Atlas: exploring north at (450, 72, -280) — "Found a massive cave system!"
- Flora: running build_farm at (285, 65, -318) — "Planting wheat row 3"
- Forge: running strip_mine at (290, 11, -315) — "Mining iron ore vein"
- Mason: running build_house at (282, 66, -322) — "Placing roof blocks"
- Blade: patrolling at (300, 68, -310) — "All clear"
```

This enables natural coordination: Flora sees Forge deposited raw iron and decides to smelt it. Mason sees Atlas found a good building spot and heads there. Blade sees Flora farming at night and patrols near her.

### Shared Stash

All bots share a central stash of categorized chests:

| Row | Category | Example Items |
|-----|----------|--------------|
| 1 | Building | logs, planks, cobblestone, glass |
| 2 | Metals & Ores | raw iron, iron ingots, copper, coal |
| 3 | Food & Farming | wheat, seeds, bread, cooked meat |
| 4 | Tools & Combat | swords, pickaxes, armor, arrows |
| 5+ | Overflow | anything else |

Mason bootstraps the first chest on spawn. When chests fill up, Mason crafts and places more. Bots deposit excess items and withdraw what they need via `deposit_stash` / `withdraw_stash` actions.

### Mission Control Dashboard

Access at `http://localhost:3010` — a single page showing all bots at a glance:

- **Bot cards** at top: real-time health, current action, last thought, position
- **3D viewer** in center: click any bot to switch the live view
- **Stash status** sidebar: inventory summary across all stash chests
- **Auto-cycle** button: toggles automatic switching between bots (30s each)
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: 1-5 to select a bot, C to toggle auto-cycle

### Port Allocation

All bots share the unified viewer at `:3000`. Per-bot ports below are the legacy fallback when the unified viewer is unavailable:

| Bot | 3D Viewer (fallback) | Overlay |
|-----|-----------|---------|
| Atlas | :3000 | :3001 |
| Flora | :3002 | :3003 |
| Forge | :3004 | :3005 |
| Mason | :3006 | :3007 |
| Blade | :3008 | :3009 |
| Dashboard | :3010 | — |

### Autonomous Decision Making

The brain is **event-driven**, not a polling loop:
- **Strategic** (every ~10s idle, or on goal completion): full world context + team bulletin + memory + tech-tree curriculum → goal-setting decision
- **Reactive** (hostiles spotted, damage taken, low health/hunger): tiny prompt, fast response
- **Critic** (after every action): verifies the result, suggests the next step or triggers a re-plan
- **Chat** (player/viewer/teammate message): in-character reply

Each decision executes a gated action (restricted to the bot's allowed actions/skills), records success/failure, and updates memory, the team bulletin, the scoreboard, and the trajectory log.

**Stuck detection:** If the same action fails 2+ times in a row, the bot is forced to choose a different approach. Failed actions are injected into the next prompt.

**Goal persistence:** The LLM can set multi-step goals (e.g., "build a house") with a step count. The bot tracks progress across decision cycles.

**Leash enforcement:** Each bot has a max distance from home. At 80% of leash radius, the LLM is warned. At 150%, the bot is force-navigated home.

**Autonomy — no cheating (default):** With `ALLOW_INTERVENTIONS=false` (the default) the LLM decides *everything*. There are no deterministic overrides that act for the bots or hand them resources. The only non-LLM helpers are reflexes a human player would do without thinking: auto-equipping the best armor a bot already owns, digging itself out when boxed in, and swimming to the surface when its head goes underwater (self-preservation, not item handouts). Setting `ALLOW_INTERVENTIONS=true` re-enables optional scaffolding (leash returns, water/buried escapes, stash bootstrap) for reliability demos — but the project's goal is capability that survives with interventions *off*.

### Skill System

**TypeScript skills** (assigned per role):
- `build_house` — build a 7x7 shelter with doors, crafting table, torches
- `build_farm` — hoe dirt, plant wheat near water, harvest when ready
- `build_bridge` — bridge across water/gaps in facing direction
- `craft_gear` — craft the best available tool set (tries diamond→iron→stone→wood per tool)
- `strip_mine` — staircase down to Y=11, then tunnel — scans the surrounding walls and follows any ore vein it exposes
- `smelt_ores` — smelt raw ore into ingots, crafts a furnace from cobblestone if needed
- `light_area` — place torches in a radius
- `go_fishing` — cast and reel a fishing rod
- `setup_stash` — bootstrap shared chest area
- `neural_combat` — 50ms tick reactive combat via Python server

**Voyager JS skills** (57 skills, run in vm sandbox):
- Crafting: `craftWoodenPickaxe`, `craftIronPickaxe`, `craftCraftingTable`, `craftFurnace`, `craftChest`, `craftBucket`, and more
- Mining: `mineWoodLog`, `mineFiveCoalOres`, `mineFiveIronOres`, `mineTenCobblestone`, and more
- Smelting: `smeltFiveRawIron`, `smeltRawCopper`, and more
- Combat: `killOnePig`, `killOneZombie`, `killFourSheep`, and more
- Gathering: `collectBamboo`, `collectFiveCactusBlocks`, `fillBucketWithWater`

**Dynamic skill generation:** Bots can generate new JS skills at runtime when existing skills don't cover a task. Generated skills are saved to `skills/generated/` and reused.

### Freeze Protection (Watchdogs)

A bot's brain loop awaits its current skill/action, so a single unbounded `await` on a server response (`pathfinder.goto` to an unreachable spot, `bot.dig` on a bad block state, a furnace GUI that never opens) used to freeze a bot **forever** — online and healthy-looking, but brain-dead. This is now impossible, enforced in layers:

- **Skill watchdog (240s)** — `runSkill` races every skill against a hard timeout that stops the pathfinder, releases any in-progress dig, and returns control to the brain (`src/skills/executor.ts`).
- **Action watchdog (150s)** — direct actions (`mine_block`, `go_to`, `gather_wood`, ...) get the same treatment at the dispatch boundary (`src/bot/actions.ts`); skills are exempt since they have their own watchdog.
- **Bounded primitives** — every `pathfinder.goto` (8–30s), `bot.dig` (12s), `bot.craft` (20s), `openFurnace`/`openContainer` (10s) inside skills/actions is wrapped in a timeout race so failures are fast, not 4 minutes.
- **Aggregate loop budgets** — loops that repeat bounded travel (stash withdrawal item-types, per-tree wood gathering, wheat harvest passes) carry a wall-clock cap, because N bounded calls still sum past a watchdog.
- **Fail-fast reachability** — `deposit_stash` bails immediately if the bot didn't actually reach the stash instead of retrying every downstream step against the same unreachable spot.

The watchdogs are the backstop; the per-call bounds make skills fail in seconds with a useful error the LLM can re-plan on. Health monitoring compares each bot's last-decision timestamp against the newest log line — a hung brain is visible even though the bot never dies.

### Persistent Memory

Each bot has its own memory file (e.g. `memory-atlas.json`, `memory-forge.json`):
- **Structures:** Location and type of every house/farm/furnace/mine built
- **Deaths:** Last 50 deaths with location and cause
- **Ore discoveries:** Locations of found ore veins
- **Skill history:** Success rate and average duration for every skill
- **Season goal:** Long-term mission set via `!goal set <text>` in-game
- **Broken skills:** Dynamic skills with 5+ failures permanently blocked

### Neural Combat

A Python TCP server (`neural_server.py`) on port 12345 responds to combat observations with: `attack`, `strafe_left`, `strafe_right`, `flee`, `use_item`, or `idle`.

Combat ticks run at 50ms intervals for up to 10 seconds per engagement. If the neural server is unreachable, bots fall back to `mineflayer-pvp`. Blade is the primary combat bot but all bots can flee from threats.

### Live Streaming

- **Mission Control** — All-bot dashboard at `http://localhost:3010`
- **Per-bot 3D viewers** — prismarine-viewer with follow/first-person/orbit camera modes
- **OBS overlays** — Per-bot WebSocket overlay showing health, food, position, inventory, thought, action
- **TTS** — Bot thoughts converted to speech and played through overlay
- **Twitch integration** — Reads Twitch chat; viewers can interact with the bots

### Survival & Resource Loops

The bots run the real Minecraft progression loops end-to-end, using only their own faculties:

- **Iron chain:** `mine_block`/`strip_mine` vein-mine ore (the miner equips the best pickaxe and follows connected ore) → `smelt_ores` turns it into ingots in a self-built furnace → `craft_gear` upgrades tools (diamond→iron→stone→wood per tool, using whatever it has).
- **Food chain:** when no hostile threatens, `attack` hunts the nearest passive animal (cow/pig/sheep/chicken), then drops are collected off the ground and `eat` consumes the best food on hand — falling back to raw meat to avoid starvation. (A `cook_food` skill to multiply raw-meat value is on the roadmap.)
- **Drop collection:** mining, gathering, and kills all walk the bot over the dropped items — nothing is left on the ground.

### Self-Improvement Loop

The team measures and improves itself across sessions:

- **Scoreboard** (`logs/sessions/<id>.json`): per-bot success rates, deaths, stash throughput, and tech-tree milestone timestamps (first log → first tool → first iron...). Compare sessions to see whether a code change helped — and revert it if not.
- **Skill curation**: skill success rates are aggregated team-wide. Skills with ≥8 real (non-precondition) failures and <10% success are retired; the prompt's skill list is ranked and annotated (`setup_stash (67% of 27)`) so the LLM prefers what works.
- **Tech-tree curriculum**: every strategic prompt includes the bot's current tech stage and a concrete next step computed from its real inventory.
- **Skill refinement** (Voyager-style): a dynamic skill that fails with a code error gets its source + error fed back to the LLM for a fixed version (old kept as `.bak`, 2 attempts/session).
- **Fine-tuning pipeline** (`finetune/`): every strategic decision is logged (exact prompt → decision → outcome) to `logs/trajectories/`. `scripts/extract-finetune-dataset.mjs` turns successful trajectories into a chat-format dataset, and `finetune/train_lora.py` LoRA-tunes Qwen3-8B on the team's own gameplay — see `finetune/README.md` for the overnight recipe.

### Safety

All chat messages and bot thoughts are filtered:
- Blocks harmful/inappropriate content
- Detects and sanitizes prompt injection attempts from player chat
- Viewer messages filtered separately with tighter rules

---

## Models

The bots' decisions all run through a single local model that fits on one 32GB
GPU. That model has changed several times as stronger local options appeared.
This is the running record.

| Model | Era | Type | Notes |
|-------|-----|------|-------|
| OpenAI GPT-3.5 / GPT-4 | 2023, single-bot origin | Cloud API | The original `mineflayer-chatgpt`: one bot on a cloud model. |
| qwen3:32b + qwen3:8b | early multi-bot | Dense pair | Large model for strategy, small one for reactions. The two swapped in and out of VRAM and thrashed. |
| qwen3.6:35b-a3b | June 2026 | MoE | One MoE for every decision type. ~3B active params, ~147 tok/s. Ended the two-model swap. |
| qwen3-minecraft:8b | June 2026 | LoRA fine-tune | Qwen3-8B trained on the team's own successful games. 8.7GB, 138 tok/s. Played competently but did not beat the stock model. Reverted. |
| qwen3.6:27b | late June 2026 | Dense | Stock model that beat the fine-tune. Baseline for the July trial. |
| **gpt-oss:20b** | **July 2026 (current)** | **MoE** | **Won the three-way trial below. ~3.6B active params, ~200 tok/s, 13GB VRAM. Reasoning-native, runs at `think: "low"`.** |

### July 2026 three-way trial

Local-only, head to head, same world and prompts, with `qwen3.6:27b` as the baseline.

| Metric | gpt-oss:20b | nemotron-3-nano | qwen3.6:27b |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Eats / hour | **10** | 1.6 | 0.7 |
| Action-failure rate | **31%** | n/a | 61% |
| Decisions / hour | **~1,700** (≈8× qwen) | n/a | baseline |
| VRAM | 13GB | n/a | n/a |

`gpt-oss:20b` won on food economy, action success, skill success, and decision
throughput. Deaths rose (2 → 5/hr) from sheer activity: about eight times more
actions per hour, though each individual decision is safer than before.

**Reasoning-native gotcha.** `qwen3.6` needs `think: false` or it burns its whole
token budget reasoning. `gpt-oss` is the reverse: with `think: false` under
`format: "json"` it terminates with empty content on roughly a third of queries
(14 of 44 in one run). `thinkFor(model)` in `src/llm/index.ts` picks the level
per model (`"low"` for gpt-oss, `false` for qwen). Same flag, opposite settings.

## Known Issues

| Issue | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Ollama JSON-schema `format` ignored | qwen3.6 on ollama 0.20.x returns prose for schema-constrained requests; plain `format:"json"` works (used). Re-test after upgrading ollama |
| Pathfinder timeouts on some goals | Bounded + watchdog-backstopped (see Freeze Protection); bots recover via critic re-plan |
| Food supply can't sustain 5 bots | Local-model ceiling: ~1 bot's intermittent farming oscillates; bots survive (Easy floors starvation at 10 HP) but productivity drops during hungry stretches |
| Farms unbuilt unless water is near | `build_farm` needs water within range of the village site |
| Neural combat untested in survival | Server is implemented and running; needs hostile mob environment |
| Generated skills may fail on first run | Mitigated: code-error failures now trigger automatic LLM refinement |

## Development

```bash
npm run dev     # Run with tsx watch (hot reload)
npm test        # Run tests
npm run build   # Compile TypeScript
```

### Adding a New TypeScript Skill

Read the [skill authoring guide](docs/skill-authoring-guide.md) for a tested example,
cancellation, Voyager loading, and dynamic generation.

1. Create `src/skills/my-skill.ts` exporting a `Skill` object from `src/skills/types.ts`; its `execute` method returns `Promise<SkillResult>`
2. Register it in `src/skills/registry.ts`
3. Add it to the appropriate bot's `allowedSkills` in `src/bot/role.ts`

### Adding a Voyager Skill

Drop a `.js` file into `skills/voyager/`. The function name must match the filename (camelCase). It will be loaded automatically by the dynamic loader.

### Adding a New Bot

1. Add a new `BotRoleConfig` in `src/bot/role.ts` with personality, allowed actions/skills, leash radius
2. Add the config to the bot roster array in `src/index.ts`
3. Add `MC_USERNAME_N` to `.env`
4. Increment `BOT_COUNT`
