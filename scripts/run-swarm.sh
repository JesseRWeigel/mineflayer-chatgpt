# Supervisor for the swarm.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# Six OOM crashes across a week, at intervals from 3h to 25h. Each one killed
# the process and left the swarm down until the next hourly health check noticed
# — sometimes an hour of five idle bots, sometimes longer.
#
# The root cause is still unknown. Five theories have died against evidence:
#   slow memory leak       heap was flat at ~200MB for up to 25h between crashes
#   generated skills       crash 3 was deposit_stash, crash 4 was flee
#   minecraft-data reload  the library caches by version
#   crafting operations    crash 4 did not craft
#   pathfinder searchRadius bounded at 96 and it crashed anyway at 8,185MB
#
# The profile is always identical: heap flat at ~200MB, then the full ceiling
# within one 2-minute sampling window. Raising the ceiling 4GB -> 8GB simply
# doubled the runaway's room, which proves it is unbounded rather than a spike
# needing headroom.
#
# So: contain the blast radius while the hunt continues. A crash becomes a ~15s
# gap instead of an hours-long outage. This does NOT fix anything, and the
# diagnostics stay in place to catch the cause eventually.
#
# RESTART_CAP exists so a genuinely broken build (syntax error, bad config)
# fails loudly instead of spinning forever.
