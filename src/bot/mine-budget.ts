// mineBlock searches for ore up to 64 blocks away and then called safeGoto with
// no timeout argument, taking the 15 second default, while tunnelling through
// solid stone with canDig=true. Sixty-four blocks of digging cannot happen in
// fifteen seconds, so the search radius and the travel budget disagreed by
// roughly an order of magnitude.
//
// Measured in one 1h48m session: 39 "Navigation timed out" and 28 "dig timeout"
// against 8 iron mined. Meanwhile bots called withdraw_stash 84 times and got
// "No iron_ingot in the stash" 86 times, because nothing was filling it.
//
// Budget scales with distance. A block underfoot still fails fast; a vein 60
// blocks down gets time to actually be reached.
