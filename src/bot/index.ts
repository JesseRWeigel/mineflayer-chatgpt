    // closedDataSet and openDataMap accumulate for the whole thinkTimeout.
    // gatherWood raises that to 30s, so an unreachable target means 30 seconds
    // of unbounded node growth.
    //
    // That is why raising the heap ceiling from 4GB to 8GB did not help: with no
    // spatial bound the search simply fills whatever memory exists and dies at
    // the new limit. The crash reached 8,185MB of an 8,192MB ceiling.
    //
    // It also explains the profile — heap flat at ~300MB, then instant death.
    // Nothing accumulates until one pathfind targets somewhere unreachable, and
    // that search never converges.
    //
    // 96. The progression here was measured, not guessed:
    //   128  OOMed at 8,184MB within minutes (volume ~8.5M positions)
    //    64  memory solved (heap max 285MB) but starved navigation:
    //        ACTION_SUCCESS_PCT 63 -> 38, "No path to the goal" 15/hr -> 80/hr,
    //        stuck 15/hr -> 166/hr, items 300/hr -> 154/hr
    //    96  ~3.4x the node budget of 64, so roughly 970MB worst case against
    //        an 8GB ceiling, while restoring reach for bots that explore ~119
    //        blocks per hop against a 200-block wood leash.
    //
    // A* only exhausts its bound when the goal is UNREACHABLE,
    // and then it explores the whole permitted volume. Node count scales with
    // the cube of the radius, so 128 blocks is roughly 8.5M candidate positions
    // (~850MB of nodes) per search, times five bots searching at once. That is
    // why searchRadius=128 still OOMed at 8,184MB within minutes.
    //
    // I sized the first bound like a travel distance instead of a memory
    // budget, then over-corrected into one too tight to navigate with. Node
    // count scales with the cube of radius, so the safe window is wide: 96 buys
    // back reach at a fraction of the ceiling.
