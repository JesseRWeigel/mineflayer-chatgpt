// src/bot/fall-tracker.ts
// Tracks how far a bot fell, for death attribution.
//
// The first version of this logged nothing across two fall deaths. It updated
// "last ground Y" on every movement tick where onGround was true — but a falling
// bot LANDS before it dies, and that landing fires a grounded tick which
// overwrote the height with the bottom of the fall. Drop computed as ~0 and the
// log suppressed itself.
//
// The height that matters is the ground the bot left, captured on the
// ground -> airborne transition and held until the next one, so it survives the
// landing tick and is still readable when the death event arrives.

 * for a 1.1 block drop. When the tracker is confused about a fall, the drop it
 * computes is precisely the number that cannot decide whether to print.
