/**
 * loot_bastion — Those Were the Days (nether/loot_bastion), which fires the
 * first time a bot opens a loot chest inside a bastion remnant.
 *
 * Unlike the fortress — which the server locates 622 blocks out in the
 * lava-locked direction, unreachable from our portal — the bastion sits at
 * nether (320,-304), only ~387 blocks from the portal exit, and we already
 * earned find_bastion by physically entering it. So this is a reachable,
 * concrete target that also drops the goods gating two more advancements:
 * a saddle (This Boat Has Legs) and crying obsidian (Not Quite Nine Lives).
 *
 * The job: cross the village portal, march dig-capable to the bastion, find a
 * chest on-site (the bot's own block search beats any remote scan), open it —
 * which generates the loot and banks the advancement — grab anything useful,
 * and come home.
