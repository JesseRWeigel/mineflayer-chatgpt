// WHAT THIS FILE PINS DOWN.
//
// Two ways this ends badly, both pinned here:
//
//   1. Starting a portal attempt without an igniter. Ten round trips to a lava
//      pool, a finished frame, and nothing to light it with.
//
//   2. Stepping through and not being able to get home. The return portal is at
//      the coordinates the bot ARRIVED at, which are not the coordinates it
//      left from -- the Nether is 8:1, so a bot that walks away and tries to
//      navigate back by overworld coordinates is lost. Record on the way in.

// ── FOURTH INSTANCE OF THE SAME PATTERN ──
//
// build_nether_portal refuses to start without flint_and_steel and told the
// model to "craft those first". craft_flint_and_steel is registered, sits in
// Forge's menu, and is named by no hint — so nothing ever pointed at it.
//
// Measured 2026-08-16, the hour after lava_bucket was earned: Forge made 22
// invoke_skill calls and not one was build_nether_portal or
// craft_flint_and_steel.
//
// The previous three instances all resolved the same way: put the sequence in
// the skill instead of asking the model to chain it across decisions. This test
// pins that the readiness message no longer just delegates upward.
