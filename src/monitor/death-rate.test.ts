// THE BUG THIS MODULE EXISTS FOR.
//
// WORST_BOT_DEATHS_PER_HR divided ONE bot's SESSION total by the SESSION
// uptime. In a 6h25m session Flora died 6 times, three of them inside the last
// hour, and Mason died 5, three of them in the same hour. The instrument
// printed "Atlas:1" and ALERTS said none.
//
// Two independent defects produced that. Either alone is enough to hide a loop:
//   1. only the session-worst bot was ever evaluated, so Flora and Mason were
//      never looked at no matter how fast they were dying;
//   2. the rate was a session-long average, so deaths concentrated in the most
//      recent hour were divided by every quiet hour that preceded them.
//
// This is the same failure the metric was written to fix, one level down. The
// swarm-wide rate hid one bot; a session-long per-bot average hides one HOUR.
