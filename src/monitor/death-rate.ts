 * Per-bot death rate over the window BETWEEN health checks.
 *
 * swarm-health.sh already learned twice that a threshold on an accumulating
 * counter is a guaranteed future false positive, and once that a swarm-wide
 * rate hides a single bot in a loop. WORST_BOT_DEATHS_PER_HR was the fix for
 * the second lesson but was written with the first still half-applied: it took
 * ONE bot's session total over the session uptime.
 *
 * That leaves a blind spot with a precise shape. Deaths concentrated in the
 * most recent hour are divided by every quiet hour before them, so the longer
 * a session stays healthy the harder it becomes for it to report a new loop.
 * A bot dying 6 times in the last hour of a 6h session reported 1/hr against a
 * 4/hr bar, and no threshold could have caught it.
 *
 * So: a rate over the RECENT window, for EVERY bot, not a session average for
 * the session leader.
